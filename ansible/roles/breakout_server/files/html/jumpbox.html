    <p>You've made it to the jump box, and next, you need to jump to the breakout server.</p>
    <p>You're going to use the same user name and password you used to log in here.</p>
    <p>Next, here's what you do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open a command prompt</li>
        <li>Type "rdesktop -u[your_user_name] -p[your_password] -f breakout"</li>
        <li>Be sure to use your actual user name and password.</li>
        <li>Also, make sure NOT to use the quotes or the brackets</li>
    <p>This will open up another remote desktop session for you.</p>
    <p>The first thing you should do is open your browser for further instructions.</p>
    <p>Have fun!</p>
